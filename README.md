The file "Path planning using Q-learning" includes the MATLAB implementation of Q-Learning algorithmon for path plannning.

The file "Simulation_of_parallel_parking" includes the MATLAB code of the whole  parallel parking process.

The file "autonomous parking" includes part of codes of parallel parking(parking space detection), but due to the uncertainty of steering information, we didn't complete the code. However, we have simulations.

The file "Task_1" includes the code of autonomous driving.
